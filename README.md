# Neural-Machine-Translation-with-Attention
Developed Neural Machine Translation model to translate text from English to French. This involved the processing of the data to train the sequence2sequence model which incorporated GloVe embedding as transfer learning to learn semantics more effectively. The model received a training and validation accuracy of 84% when evaluated with BLEU metrics. This model was then extended with attention mechanism, which makes it possible to encode relevant parts of the original language at each step to improve translation accuracy for longer sentences. The addition of attention improved the BLEU validation accuracy to 89%.
